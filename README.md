ðŸ“¦ Vendor & Brand Performance Analysis Dashboard â€” SQL | Python | Power BI
This project is a comprehensive end-to-end data analytics case study focused on analyzing vendor and brand performance using SQL, Python, and Power BI. The primary objective of this analysis is to evaluate sales trends, profit margins, stock turnover rates, and inventory value to derive actionable insights that help optimize vendor relationships and business strategies. This project mirrors real-world data analyst workflows and is ideal for portfolio demonstration or interview preparation.

We start by understanding the business problem, where we aim to identify high and low-performing vendors based on metrics such as total sales, profit margin, purchase contribution, and stock turnover. The dataset, stored in a local SQLite database, is first queried and cleaned using SQL. Data inconsistencies, such as missing or zero values in key columns like Gross Profit, Purchase Quantity, or Sales Quantity, are filtered out to maintain analysis accuracy.

The cleaned dataset is then imported into Python for in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). We use libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize trends and patterns. Visualizations include scatter plots for profit margins vs. sales, bar charts for top vendors/brands, box plots for unit pricing in bulk purchases, and Pareto charts to understand vendor contributions. We also conduct hypothesis testing and calculate confidence intervals to determine whether top-performing vendors have statistically significant differences in profitability compared to low-performing vendors.

In the final phase, we build an interactive dashboard in Power BI. This dashboard showcases KPIs such as total revenue, purchase contribution, unsold capital, average profit margin, and top 10 vendor/brand lists. We use DAX formulas to calculate metrics like PurchaseContribution, UnsoldInventoryValue, and AvgStockTurnover. Additional measures help segment vendors by performance using quantiles and filter the data interactively for business users. The color palette and chart types are carefully chosen to enhance readability and storytelling. The final dashboard includes donut charts, line plots, stacked bars, and dynamic slicers for a seamless analytical experience.

This project is a demonstration of how various data tools can be used together in a real-world workflow. It simulates a business scenario where an analyst must clean raw data, extract meaningful patterns, perform statistical analysis, and present the insights in an accessible and professional format. It is perfect for anyone preparing for a data analyst role, participating in hackathons, or simply looking to build an impressive data portfolio  project.
